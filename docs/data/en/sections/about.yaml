# a summary about you
summary: 'A workflow programming framework designed for constructing agentic applications with LLMs. It implements by the scheduling of computational units (`Neuron`), that may include loops, by constructing a `Brain` (a directed graph that can have cycles) or support the loop-less DAGs. A `Brain` consists of multiple `Neurons` connected by `Link`s. Inspiration was drawn from [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph). The `Memory` of a `Brain` leverages [ristretto](https://github.com/dgraph-io/ristretto) for its implementation.
<br><br> **You can build any `Brains` with zenmodel. <br>The examples are for inspiration only, and more are defined by you.**<br><br>
